# WebProxy
Simple sequential proxy that repeatedly waits for a request, forwards the request to the end server, and returns the result back to the browser, keeping a log of such requests in a disk file. Supports only HTTP using GET requests. The program was written in C using Xcode. To run the program, make sure that all HTTP traffic is passing through the proxy on a specified port. I implemented main.c
